    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Our company started with Mario Mitchell III while he was in college. He had multiple overnight sessions studying chemistry and the effects of melatonin. His overnight sessions and drive to study this chemistry did not come from his major but from his struggle with sleep. On Valentineâ€™s Day in 2021, Dr Mitchell was experimenting with melatonin when his girlfriend brought him some chocolate. Unknowing what the effect of these two chemicals combined would be he ate the chocolate and took his experimental melatonin. He then slept and had the most peaceful sleep he has had ever. That is when Sweet Sleep was born.    

Because of this, we have created a mission to satisfy the college students who are unable to sleep and get a satisfactory amount of rest.

Our vision is to create a high-quality and inexpensive chocolate that students seek out when needing more help to sleep</p>
